Implement system-generated IP addresses
Allow users to change username
Error checking for file opening

Issue with password and IP address occassionally being sent together. 
    Could server.setblocking() be a solution somehow
    Check if send has return value and check return value for ip send, if not true, retry main menu

The user sends a message to the server containing the user they want to chat with
 - Print list of users 
Server either creates a new file or responds with the contents of the file    

Usernames_list should be dynamically allocated during the traversal of the user_details file but ahhh

TODO: Use strtok to split string instead of shifting pointer when comparing for login

Free all malloced arrays

Chat selection 
- User selects username 
- Access user id for that username

TODO - Add timeout to login and signup on client side to restart process for the occassional situation when password and IP get sent together

Send integer representing desired chat, run chat search with current username and desired usernamed
Will need to match user names to IDs 

ISSUE - Unpredictability 
1. With login info (password and IP being sent together)
2. With chat participant assignment and chat paricipant ID assignment from server, leads to segmentation faults at times. Need to identify trend there
TODO - Send username, password and IP address together and use delimiter (solves 1)


 FIXED - With user list reception on client side, delimiting character showing end of list is not recognized as end of list leading to a stall

TODO: Create new file for chat that doesn't exist

SAMUEL 
- Need to update the chat_ID variable for new chat between two clients to enable us to write to the right file
- Server needs to recognize the chat_in_progress and then read user messages (in else)
- Should user be able to return to chat selection menu. Basically end a chat with someone and start a chat with someone else without closing the connection and logging out
