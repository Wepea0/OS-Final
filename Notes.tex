Implement system-generated IP addresses
Allow users to change username
Error checking for file opening

Issue with password and IP address occassionally being sent together. 
    Could server.setblocking() be a solution somehow
    Check if send has return value and check return value for ip send, if not true, retry main menu

The user sends a message to the server containing the user they want to chat with
 - Print list of users 
Server either creates a new file or responds with the contents of the file    

Usernames_list should be dynamically allocated during the traversal of the user_details file but ahhh

TODO: Use strtok to split string instead of shifting pointer when comparing for login
