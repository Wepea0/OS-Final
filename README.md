# Project Description
This project seeks to demonstrate interprocess communication within computer systems. To do this, it leverages sockets and the use of communication over sockets to show how computer systems use interprocess communication. The project has a server which is written in C and this server connects a number of clients at a time and enables them to have conversations. These conversations are sent back and forth from clients to server and back to clients using sockets. The clients are written in Python And this clients can be accessed through a Geo I which is constructed using the web framework Django.
The project led the developers to explore a number of different concepts, including. 
•	Multithreading.
•	TCP/IP.
•	Communication over sockets.
•	Django and websockets
•	Python Graphical user interface
•	Multi-language programming
